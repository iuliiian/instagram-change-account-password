This script aims to streamline the process of enhancing security across multiple Instagram profiles by changing passwords effectively and efficiently.

In this script, we use the Selenium web driver to automate the process of logging in to each Instagram account and changing its password. The script takes a list of account details in the form of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the username/email and current password for an account. We also set a new password that will be used for all accounts.
